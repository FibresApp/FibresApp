<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App Name:</strong> Fibres - Progress Photos</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

<p>
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Fibres - Progress Photos
(“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles your information.
</p>

<h2>1. Photos and Images</h2>
<p>
All photos added to Fibres - Progress Photos remain on your device and within the app.
We do not permanently store your photos on our own servers.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to use features that require photo analysis (available to premium users),
selected photos are securely transmitted to a third-party AI service (OpenAI) solely
for the purpose of analysis.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Photos are sent only when analysis is requested by the user</li>
    <li>Photos are used strictly to generate analysis results</li>
    <li>Photos are not stored by OpenAI after processing</li>
    <li>Photos are not used to train AI models</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. AI Analysis Data</h2>
<p>
Text-based analysis results generated from your photos are stored locally on your device
so you can view them within the app.
</p>

<p>
These analysis results remain accessible while your premium subscription is active.
If you cancel your premium subscription, access to premium analysis features and stored
analysis results may be removed.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
Fibres - Progress Photos does not maintain a central user database containing your photos.
All personal content, including images and analysis results, is stored locally on your device
unless explicitly stated otherwise.
</p>

<h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
<p>
Fibres - Progress Photos offers auto-renewable subscriptions through Apple’s App Store.
We do not collect or store your payment information.
</p>

<p>
All payments and subscription management are handled by Apple. You can manage or cancel
your subscription through your Apple ID account settings.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App uses third-party services only when necessary to provide core functionality,
including AI-powered image analysis.
</p>

<p>
These services may temporarily process data solely to perform requested operations and
are contractually restricted from using your data for other purposes.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with advertisers or data brokers.
Your information is only shared when required to provide app functionality or comply
with legal obligations.
</p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<p>
We take reasonable measures to protect your data. Data transmitted for analysis is sent
over secure connections. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is
100% secure.
</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Fibres - Progress Photos is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
</p>

<h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
You control your data within the app. You may delete photos at any time by removing them
from the app. Uninstalling the app removes locally stored data from your device.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
with an updated revision date.
</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
