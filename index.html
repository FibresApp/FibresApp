        <p><strong>Fibres – Progress Photos</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 9, 2026</p>

        <p>
            Fibres – Progress Photos (“Fibres”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy.
            This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our mobile
            application available on iOS and Android.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>User-Provided Content</strong></p>
        <p>
            Fibres allows users to upload photos for the purpose of tracking fitness progress.
            These photos are uploaded voluntarily by the user and are used only to provide
            app functionality such as progress tracking and photo comparison.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you choose to use AI-powered features, uploaded images may be processed by
            a third-party AI service to generate analysis and insights.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use user-provided information solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable photo storage and progress comparison</li>
            <li>Provide AI-based image analysis (if enabled)</li>
            <li>Deliver app features and functionality</li>
            <li>Manage subscriptions and access to premium features</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We do not use your data for advertising or marketing purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>3. AI Image Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Fibres uses a third-party AI service to analyze user-uploaded images when AI
            features are enabled. This analysis is performed only to provide feedback
            and insights within the app.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Images are not used to identify users</li>
            <li>Images are not sold</li>
            <li>Images are not used to train AI models for unrelated purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
        <p>
            Fibres uses RevenueCat to manage subscriptions and in-app purchases.
            Payment information is handled directly by:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Apple App Store (iOS)</li>
            <li>Google Play Store (Android)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Fibres does not collect or store payment or billing information.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent, or trade user data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data may be shared only with service providers required to operate app features,
            such as AI processing and subscription management. These providers are required
            to handle data securely and only for the intended purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            User-uploaded photos and related data are retained as long as your account
            remains active or until you choose to delete them. You may delete your content
            at any time from within the app.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable measures to protect user data from unauthorized access,
            loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot
            guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>

            Fibres is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
            collect personal information from children.
